Genetic Algorithm Network Reconfiguration
=====================

Genetic algorithm for reducing the power loss in an electrical network consisting out of 119 nodes.
Based on the paper:
Zhang, Dong, Zhengcai Fu, and Liuchun Zhang. "An improved TS algorithm for loss-minimum reconfiguration in large-scale distribution systems." Electric Power Systems Research 77.5 (2007): 685-694.

The network has binary encoded 2^132 search options, sequence encoded 1.44*10^18 search options. Consequently the search space is much to large to brute-force the optimal network configuration within a reasonable time span. 
Therefore we reconfigure the network by using a genetic algorithm and see if we can achieve the lowest power loss in the network within a reasonable time frame. The result is compared with a simple Monte Carlo algorithm.

The genetic algorithm is based on two functions that use the matlab matpower package: http://www.pserc.cornell.edu/matpower/
we used version 4.1. Both the functions are from Kaifeng Yang.
