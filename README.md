Genetic Algorithm Network Reconfiguration
=====================

Genetic algorithm for reducing the power loss in an electrical network consisting out of 119 nodes.
Based on the paper:
Zhang, Dong, Zhengcai Fu, and Liuchun Zhang. "An improved TS algorithm for loss-minimum reconfiguration in large-scale distribution systems." Electric Power Systems Research 77.5 (2007): 685-694.

The network has binary encoded 2^132 search options, sequence encoded 1.44*10^18 search options. Consequently the search space is much to large to brute-force the optimal network configuration within a reasonable time span. 
Therefore we reconfigure the network by using a genetic algorithm and see if we can achieve the lowest power loss in the network within a reasonable time frame. The result is compared with a simple Monte Carlo algorithm.

The genetic algorithm is based on two functions that use the matlab matpower package: http://www.pserc.cornell.edu/matpower/ We assume the package directory is situated in the working directory. we used version 4.1. Both the functions, valid_119.m & calculation_119.m are from Kaifeng Yang. 

Main result

![Result](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sirvincent/ga_network_reconfiguration/master/performance.png)
The genetic algorithm found the lowest power loss achievable in the electrical network; 869.7272 kW within 70 seconds.

Future Work
-----------
A report will be uploaded explaining in detail the found results and the genetic algorithm implemented.
